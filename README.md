# ElectricityBill

Mini project

Auther: Mohammed Nayaz

Here I have coded this program as exact as the bill that appears in BESCOM electricity board,
"The attributes/costs may vary depending upon the city and service providers"

Technique used:
Data Abstraction, 
Data Ancapsulation, 
Multilevel Inheritence.

1. Electricity bill for only domestic purpose
